<img src="images/Girl.jpg" width="900" height="566" alt="Me" align="left" hspace=40 vspace=30 border ="5"">

<p>If you're involved in an internet marketing business, then
you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1
enemy - "Time Wasting".</p>

<p>What you need to know is that "Time Is Money". And this
applies even more to the online world, than in regular
business.</p>

<p>You see, anyone can become an online entrepreneur. It
doesn't involve start-up capital or expensive equipment to
start. A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.</p>

<p>And since cash isn't really a barrier, time-management has
become all the more critical. Your challenge for success is
simply to get more done - in less time.</p>

<p class="what">So what are the greatest online time wasters and what can
you do to avoid them?</p>
<ol>
<li>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</li>
<li>Failing to manage your email effectively.</li>
<li>Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.</li>
<li>Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.</li>
</ol>

<p>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</p>
------------------------------------------------

<p>This sounds simple. But stop and think how many times you
retype the same old simple information.</p>

<p>Most people have cottoned on to automating their email
signature, but you can go far beyond that when it comes to
communicating words quickly.</p>

<p>Get yourself a clickboard or shortcut extender. This will
enable you to write much faster and prevent you from ever
having to type the same thing twice.</p>

<p>I use this utility http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot , but
there are lots of other useful typing assistant utilities
available.</p>

<p>Failing to manage your email effectively.</p>
-----------------------------------------

<p>I know, there's so much spam flying around, but you should
be attempting to win this war with a few weapons of your
own installed on your computer.</p>

<ul type="square">
<li> Make sure you have a working piece of anti-spam software
set up. Whilst sometimes the wrong messages will get
trapped, the best software will still remove 98% of the
emails that you don't want. Make sure they are filtered
into a junk email file, so you can manually sift
through them afterwards and pull back any that have
been incorrectly assumed to be unwanted.</li>

<li>Set up folders in your inbox and get yourself properly
organized. I keep a folder for SALES, another one for
FEEDBACK and others for JOINT VENTURES + many more. </li>
</ul>

<p><h1> Part 2</h1></p>
<p><h2>Advices</h2></p>

<p><ol>
<h2><li> Procrastination</h2>

I have really lost count of the number of hours I spend (yes, still now if I don’t watch myself) trying to work out what would be best to do with that day, how to make the most of my time etc… – only to find that the day has passed and I’ve still got nothing done.


SO FRUSTRATING!

How to avoid

Your diary really should be your best friend when it comes to managing your time. I really get the most out of my day now that I use mine religiously.

Add in any unmovable appointments along with travel and prep time for each, then add in any errands or jobs you have to do that day. In any spare time you have you can then look at your TO DO list and work out the top priority for that day, and add it in.

New Habit – Check your diary for the week ahead, and then every evening for the next day. You can add TO DOs, errands etc… into any gaps so you avoid not knowing what to do when you get there. </li>

<h2><li>Social Media and email</h2>

These should all come with a warning – once you have signed into Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, your email, etc… then time will pass by double quick.

People often say to me that they hadn’t realised how long they spent on these things until they were asked to time how much of a day they spent on it – and most were horrified!

How to avoid

It’s impossible to not spend time on social media and email nowadays, most people use it in one way or another – but it’s important not to let it take over.

Spending a set time 2 or three times a day works best – usually first thing in the morning, at lunchtime, and last thing at night. It’s also worth remembering that everyone can wait – and a few hours won’t hurt!

New Habit – Look at social media at set times in your day – times that work best for you, and when you don’t have other things to be doing.</li>

<h2><li> Things that take you away from your goals</h2>

Your goals are what you will look back on and feel a sense of pride in if you have achieved them, but feel deflated it not. Therefore it makes sense that anything that takes you directly away from your goals is wasting your time.

Things such as hobbies that you don’t really enjoy anymore, groups that you are a member of that have a lot of time commitment but don’t relate to your goals, friends who make you feel low when you are with them, and working all the hours you have in a dead end job when you would rather start your own business….

How to avoid

Really look at how you spend your time, and what proportion of what you do is helping your towards your goals in life. You may be surprised at the results.

With those things that you really should drop, get out of them confidently and learn to say NO more to things that don’t help you.

There will of course be some things that you can’t avoid in life – but if you can manage things better then you will have more time to get to where you want to be in life, and ultimately this will make you happier.

New Habit – Learn to say NO more to things that you don’t want or need to do. Saying NO to these things means you are saying YES to those things that actually do matter. </li>

<h2><li> Unimportant TV </h2>

I have clarified in the title that it’s not just TV that’s a time waster. On the contrary. There are some TV programmes that can be useful, relaxing, and entertaining.

What I am talking about is watching things just for the sake of it.

Flicking through the endless channels available and not really watching much of anything – or simply the habit of watching TV every night and not doing something else that would make you happier. All of the above are a complete waste of time.

How to avoid

One very easy way to do this is to invest in TV systems that allow you to record (Such as Virgin Media or SKY). You can record programmes and series and watch them when you want to and not be dictated to by the schedule.


Another big bonus is that you can fast forward through the breaks, and you can watch more of what you want to watch at a time that suits you.

The other option is of course to simply limit how much TV you allow yourself each day, and see how much more you get done!

New Habit – Record everything you want to watch, and stop being dictated by their schedule. Watch when you have time and you will soon start to see what you really want to watch! </li>
